This project would randomize drink selections like toppings, milks, coffee shots, flavor shots, temperature, etc. for someone who wants to try a new drink at their local cafe. (like Starbucks!)

This is important because coffee is a staple for a lot of college students and adults alike and a lot of people do not know how many different combinations there are for good drinks. Also this would be fun for people to use and the coding would be complex to some extent but not impossible to do.

We would use primarily C++, and use specifically the math library to generate certain items randomly.

Our input would be the weather type, such as whether the weather is sunny, rainy, or cloudy. A user could input what the weather is like outside and the randomizer would automatically adjust which features/aspects of the drink would be included, like whether the drink is hot or cold, has ice or not, and has whipped cream or other temperature-dependent factors or not. This way, the user would not have to keep pressing on a button to generate a random drink so many times and would be able to get one faster.

The output would be the selection made for each individual selection made by the randomizer. The user would also receive an output if they were to input yes for any allergies, which should output altered selections to not include those specific combinations.

One feature we would have is the option to select allergies or dietary restrictions, while another would be one that ranks the drink combination on a scale from 1-5 depending on how it tasted with 1 being not the greatest and 5 being the best. Additionally, recipe suggestions based on user preferences and the nutritional information could be one. Another possibility is that a user can create an account and save their history of drinks. 


## Class Diagram
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
